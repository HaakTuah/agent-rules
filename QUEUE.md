# The core's queue

The order this repository's open issues are built in, and nothing else (`AGENTS.md`, "The queue"). Each line is an
issue, who builds it and what it waits on; the issue holds the rest, its conditions too. The first line that waits on
nothing is next, and a line leaves in the pull request that closes its issue.

**Who:** *builder*, any builder session; *rule builder*, a builder on Opus, who writes the rule from the owner's words
on the issue; *the owner*, no session takes it up before the owner's own word. **The owner's yes** that floor rule 3
asks for is the one given when the line's issue was queued, relayed into its pull request (`AGENTS.md`, "Queued means
wanted").
