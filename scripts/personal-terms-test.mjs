// Checks the personal-terms check (floor rule 11; .github/workflows/personal-terms.yml): its own job, run as GitHub
// runs it (workflow-run.mjs, beside this file), on scratch pull requests, each checked out as GitHub checks one out: its
// merge into its base. What fails: a term in a file, in a line a commit adds and a later one takes away, in a line a
// merge's own resolution adds (an octopus merge's too), in a file's name (an empty file, a rename, a binary file, a
// name outside plain ASCII; never printed, in whatever case, where the file's content holds one too), in a commit's
// message, author or committer (name or address), in a private repository too, its failure saying how to mend it, and
// in the title, description or branch name; a file of text a .gitattributes marks binary, main's own too; a term listed
// with blanks or a Windows line end around it; a commit dated before the rule too, since a date is whatever its maker
// writes; each failure saying how the session takes the term out; a term in a link like a Claude Code session's but of
// another shape or host, inside another address, or beside one (#261).
// What passes: none of these; a term only in a file whose content is binary (not read); one only inside a Claude Code
// session link's random id, wherever the check reads text; a file on main named with
// a term before the rule, deleted or renamed away; only in the
// author of a commit GitHub itself made (floor rule 11's exception: a merge or an edit on github.com, under a profile
// GitHub wrote on a merge of main's, not one through its API under an author its caller named), committed as GitHub and
// signed by its key, while
// one written to look so (unsigned, signed by another key, or with a certificate made to look like GitHub's) fails, and so does every merge's author where the key
// cannot be fetched; only in a commit of the base's, though the event
// names an older base; and a repository without the secret. The terms are invented, built from pieces as the test
// runs, so no file holds them. On Linux and on Windows. Git, bash and Node's own modules.
