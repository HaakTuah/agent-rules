// Is this pull request's change to what runs by itself only comments and steps' names (floor rule 3)? Such a change
// passes one security review, floor rule 8's, instead of rule 3's two. Its builder runs it from a checkout of the
// core's `main`, never from the pull request's own copy, which the pull request could change, in the pull request's
// clone with the head that merges checked out, up to date with `main` (floor rule 12):
//
//   node <the core's main>/scripts/comment-only.mjs [<a commit already reviewed>]
//
// It reads the head commit, not the working tree, against the merge base with the project's main (fetched), or against
// the commit given, one before the head that it grew from, for a later commit reviewed only for what it changes (floor
// rule 8); a head not up to date with main is refused, being no head that merges. It reads every file the pull request
// changes under .github/ or .claude/ (the folders themselves too, any case, at any depth), and every action.yml, a
// project's own action: each must be a YAML file changed in place, its mode kept, no link or submodule there on either
// side, whose two versions differ only in YAML comments, blank lines between entries, and the `name` of a job's steps.
// A step's name is the first key of an item under `jobs.<job>.steps` that YAML reads as text: holding no `${{` and no
// backslash, which in quotes could spell one, so nothing is evaluated; quoted and not empty, or plain from a letter and
// none of the words YAML reads as null, true or false. A comment a tool may read as an instruction (an ignore, a
// disable, a skip, a linter's or scanner's name) must stand word for word beside the same line as before, and the note
// beside an action's version (`uses:`) must stand. It reads YAML as GitHub's parser does where it reads it at all, and
// refuses, rather than guess, every line it cannot read for sure: a tab, a carriage return or another control character
// or line break, a byte order mark, a character YAML refuses; a value that runs on to the next line (a quoted or plain
// one, or one in [ ] or { }); a quote or # inside [ ] or { }; an anchor, alias, tag, explicit key or document marker. A
// line inside a block scalar (`run: |`) is text, a # line too, and changes nothing only where it is unchanged; the blank
// lines after its last are not, unless it keeps them (`|+`). Of the
// files outside what it reads, it refuses those that run by themselves or decide what does (RUNS_TOO below) and lists
// the rest: it exits 0 where there are none, 1 where it refuses, and 2 where others changed, which the session's
// "Security review:" comment says of, file by file, why each runs neither by itself nor with credentials
// (modules/reviews.md, point 3). It prints the head it checked, for that comment and the merge. Git and Node's own
// modules only; it changes nothing.
